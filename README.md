# Vault Integration Pack

This pack is for Hashicorp Vault integrations

## Configuration

Copy the example configuration in [vault.yaml.example](./vault.yaml.example)
to `/opt/stackstorm/configs/vault.yaml` and edit as required.

It should contain:

* `url` - URL for the Vault server
* `cert` - Path to client-side certificate
* `token` - Authentication token
* `verify` - Whether to verify the SSL certificate or not

You can also use dynamic values from the datastore. See the

**Note** : When modifying the configuration in `/opt/stackstorm/configs/` please
           remember to tell StackStorm to load these new values by running
           `st2ctl reload --register-configs`
